## To Follow Along:

* Run `lein gorilla` to start up [Gorilla REPL](http://gorilla-repl.org/)
  * All dependencies will be retrieved
  * After a little while, a REPL prompt will appear at the command line
  * Instructions with a URL to open in your browser, and nREPL connection info will be printed - something like:
  ```sh
$ lein gorilla
Gorilla-REPL: 0.3.4
Started nREPL server on port 55632
Running at http://127.0.0.1:55634/worksheet.html .
Ctrl+C to exit.
  ```
* Open the Gorilla URL as indicated, and load (`<ctrl>+g <ctrl>+l`)
  the `src/den_of_clojure/sec1.clj` worksheet

## Other Usage

* Run `lein ubersource` to pull down source for all dependencies.
  * Sources will be downloaded in `target/ubersource/`
